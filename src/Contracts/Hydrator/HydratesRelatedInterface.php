     * domain records, the primary record will need to exist *before* this data is transferred. This is
     * common if the resource contains representations of has-many relationships that need to be
     * populated into a database. Or if the resource's attributes contain attribute values that are
     * actually read from related domain records rather than the primary record that the resource belongs to.
